# Introduction

## Data Models

### Structured

All database elements have a fixed foramt, like the relational model.

### Semi-structured

There is some kind of structure but it is not fixed, like XML.

### Unstructured

No structure whatsoever at all, complete chaos if you want, but usually an conceptual structure is imposed, very flexible tho.

like MongoDB for example, and any NoSQL database.

#### Types of NoSQL databases

- Document (like MongoDB)
- Key value (like any DBMS that uses JSON)
- Graph (like the one used to Facebook's friend graph)
- Column (no idea what that is)

## Some Definitions

### DBMS (Database Management System)

A software system that manages the access to a database.

### Database program

A software application that accesses a database through a DBMS.

## Why use a DBMS?

A DBMS will control data redundancy in a database. It will also help make the database consistent by improving data integrity.
It opens the door to query processing and transaction management, as well as to data recovery and concurrency control (i.e. allowing
multiple users to access the same database simultaneously)
